Browser vendors and JavaScript developers were overwhelmed with the sheer number of new features to adopt and learn. Since then, to prevent such a big drop of new features happening at once, there’s been a yearly release cycle.",
                        "This yearly release cycle involves proposing any new features, which are then discussed, evaluated, then voted on by a committee before they’re added to the language. This process also allows browsers to try to implement the proposals before they’re officially added to the language, which may help iron out any implementation problems."
